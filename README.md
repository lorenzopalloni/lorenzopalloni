# Hello there! 👋 I'm Lorenzo

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about the intersection of research and applied science. Here's a little bit more about me:

- 🤖 I am deeply enthusiastic about Machine Learning, always staying on the cutting edge of algorithms, tools, and best practices.
- 🧙 I'm on my journey to becoming an open sourcerer, believing in the power of collaboration and shared knowledge.
- 💪 Outside the world of code, I enjoy pushing my physical limits with Weighted Calisthenics.
- 🐧 I'm an avid user and advocate for (Arch) Linux, loving the flexibility, transparency, and community it offers.
- 📝 Vim is my go-to text editor. It's efficient, reliable, and -- once you've got the hang of it -- a joy to use.
